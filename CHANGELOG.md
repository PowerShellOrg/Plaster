# Plaster Release History

## 0.2.0
### Saturday, July 30, 2016

- Restructured the module source to follow best practice of separating infrastructure from module files.
  Or so @RamblingCookieMonster tells me.  :-)
- Fixed #47: How to create empty directories.  The `<file>` directive supports this now.
- Fixed #58: File recurse does not work anymore.
